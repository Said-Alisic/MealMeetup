# **Meal Meetup**

### Introduction

Welcome to Meal Meetup, a simple React.js web application! The application connects 
to the "TheMealDB" API from `https://www.themealdb.com`, which hosts many free recipes 
from meaty dishes to vegan delicacies and more. This is a simple project I made to try my hand on 
creating an intuitive React web application that is hosted on vercel with a simple functionality.

## Technologies used

- npm
